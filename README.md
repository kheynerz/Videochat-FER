## Installation

Make sure to have [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) installed globally before getting started.

```bash
pip install pipenv
```

Next, run these commands in the project's root directory:
```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
pipenv shell

# Install project dependencies
pipenv install
```

This command will read the Pipfile and create a virtual environment with the necessary dependencies.

## Usage
The entry point for the project is the main.py file. Make sure to execute this file to start the application.
```bash
python main.py
```

That's it! You should now have the project installed and running within your virtual environment.
